Chapter 1: Calling R from SAS; 

The purpose of this file is to house notes from SAS's 
"SAS Programming for R Users" course. 

The syntax of R and SAS vary slightly, and this course aims to point out the 
relevant differences, show how tasks can be accomplished using both programming
tools, and show how SAS and R can complement eachother. 

Note, this course also introduces SQL concepts in course around chapter 3. 

The below code chunk (SAS) shows how we can call R from SAS

```{r echo = TRUE}
#SAS CODE
# PROC iml; 
#   call ExportDataSetToR("Work.Birth","Birth");
# 
      submit / r;
        library(randomForest)
      rf = randomForest(BWT ~ SMOKE + HT + LWT + PTW, data= birth
                                                    , ntree =200
                                                    , importance = 1)
      summary(rf)
      actual = birth$BWT
      pred = predict(rf, data=birth)
      actual.pred = cbind(actual,pred)
      colnames(actual.pred) <- c("Actual", "Predicted")
#   endsubmit;
# 
# call ImportDataSetFromR("Rdata", "actual.pred");
# quit; 
```
